Step 2: Import this mesh to Unreal engine.

Step 3: In the default level created make a landscape with suitable texturing

Step 4: After creating a proper landscape with ocean and required assets we have to save our level.

Step 5: Then create a blueprint for this boat mesh 

Step 6: In the blueprint create a buoyancy for the object and include static mesh 

Step 7: Once all these are created, Create phontoons for the four points on the boat object at the relative locations.

Step 8: To make the boat float activate the buoyancy and save all these.

Step 9: Finally, play this level with simulation to see the boat floating on the created ocean.
